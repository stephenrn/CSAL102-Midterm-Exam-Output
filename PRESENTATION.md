# Moore to Mealy Machine Converter â€“ Presentation Outline

## 1. Introduction
- Briefly explain Moore and Mealy machines.
- State the goal: converting a Moore machine to an equivalent Mealy machine.

## 2. Theory
- Moore: output per state.
- Mealy: output per transition.
- Conversion: output for a transition is the output of the destination state in the Moore machine.

## 3. Implementation
- Data structures for states, alphabet, transitions, and outputs.
- Conversion algorithm (walk through code logic).
- Input/output format.

## 4. Demonstration
- Show three test cases of increasing complexity.
- Display program output for each.

## 5. Testing and Verification
- How test cases were chosen.
- How correctness was checked.

## 6. AI Assistance
- Which parts were AI-assisted (code, documentation).
- How suggestions were reviewed and improved.

## 7. Q&A
- Be ready to explain the conversion process and code.
